### Hi, I'm Nico!
The main purpose of this page is to test my HTML and CSS skills. They are very primitive. I’m using the Odin Project to learn Frontend Development/ Backend Development.

## Home Page
I’m giving three options of styles for a landing page. I had three; the “Basic” layout is the one Landing page I had to make as a project for the Odin Project. The others “Retro” and “Brutalist” were ideas I had to have some fun with my little knowledge of CSS.
